# Wine Quality Prediction Project

## Introduction
Welcome to my Wine Quality Prediction project! As someone new to data science, data analytics, and machine learning, I decided to embark on this project to gain hands-on experience and learn more about these fields. This project marks my first step into the world of data analysis and machine learning, and I'm excited to share my journey with you.

## Project Overview
In this project, I aimed to predict the quality of wines based on various chemical attributes using a machine learning model. I utilized the popular programming language Python, along with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and seaborn, to analyze the dataset and build a predictive model.

## Files
- `winequality.csv`: This CSV file contains the dataset I used for this project. It includes various chemical attributes of wines and their corresponding quality ratings.

- `Wine_Quality_Prediction.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook is the heart of my project. It walks through the data analysis process, visualization, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Exploration**: I began by exploring the dataset to understand its structure, checking for missing values, and gaining insights into the data.

2. **Data Visualization**: Using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn, I created visualizations to better understand the relationships between the features and the wine quality.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: I cleaned the dataset, handled any missing values, and standardized the features for training the model.

4. **Model Training**: I used a Random Forest Classifier to train a machine learning model on the dataset.

5. **Model Evaluation**: I evaluated the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Getting Started
- If you're new to data science and machine learning, you can use this project as a reference to learn about various steps involved in a typical data analysis and machine learning.
